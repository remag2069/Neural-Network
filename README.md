# Neural-Network
Personal Neural networks built from scratch using only Random library

Built a frame-work for Neural Network
* Using only python and its random library, designed the forward and backward pass of a perceptron
* Extended the model to MLP capable of complex computations like XOR (gate representation), quadratic equations.
